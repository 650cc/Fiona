Fiona
=====

Fiona is OGR's neater API â€“ sleek elegance on the outside, unstoppable OGR(e)
on the inside.

Fiona provides a minimal Python interface to the open source GIS community's
most trusted geodata access library and integrates readily with other Python
GIS packages such as pyproj_, Rtree_, and Shapely_.

Dependencies
============

Fiona requires libgdal 1.3.2+.

Building and testing
====================

Tests require Nose. From the distribution root::

  $ virtualenv .
  $ source bin/activate
  (Fiona)$ ./cypsrc
  (Fiona)$ python setup.py build_ext -I ${GDAL}/include -L ${GDAL}/lib develop
  (Fiona)$ python setup.py nosetests

If GDAL/OGR headers and libs aren't installed to a well known location, you'll
need to pass the locations in using setup arguments as shown above.

Usage
=====

Collections are used much like files. Features are mappings::

  from fiona import collection
  from shapely import asShape, mapping

  # Open a source of features
  with collection("docs/data/test_uk.shp", "r") as source:
  
      # Define a schema for the feature sink
      schema = input.schema.copy()
      schema['geometry'] = 'Point'
      
      # Open a new sink for features
      with collection(
          "test_write.shp", "w", driver="ESRI Shapefile", schema=schema
          ) as sink:
          
          # Process only the features intersecting a box
          for f in source.filter(bbox=(-5.0, 55.0, 0.0, 60.0)):
          
              # Get their centroids using Shapely
              f['geometry'] = mapping(asShape(f['geometry']).centroid)
              
              # Stage feature for writing
              sink.write(f)
              
              # The sink shapefile is written to disk when the surrounding
              # ``with`` block ends
